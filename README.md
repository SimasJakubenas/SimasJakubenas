> Hi, my name is Simas Jakubenas and I've acquired a diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute. I love working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and python. I envision my work through the lense of UX design and harness the power of Design Thinking and Agile methodologies to plan and develop projecs.
>
> Furthermore I've succesfully completed Artificial Intelligence and Python Programming course with CodeAcademy (LT). I've improved on my Python programming skills and strenghten my knowledge of such processes: data acquisition, data proccessing and data visualization. I've learned the use and practical application of Machine Learning models in solving real life problems.
